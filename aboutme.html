								<p><b>What have I been up to?</b></br></br>
									Along with academics and professional development, I have continued pursuing my other passion – playing soccer. In 2019, I arrived in Peoria, Illinois for the first time starting my journey
									as a student athlete pursuing a B.Sc. in Management Information Systems and Business Analytics at Bradley University: Foster College of Business, 
									and playing for Bradley Men's Soccer in NCAA Division 1, Missouri Valley Conference.
									During my time here, I have had the privilege of combining perspectives from both business and technology; developing an ample set of problem-solving skills for the data driven future.</p>
									<p><b>What's important now?</b></br></br>
									“Forward!” said the granny stuck in the snow. (– an important Finnish life lesson)</br>
									Now that I am stepping into my final stages of both undergrad studies and college athletics career, it is time to reflect the great experiences I have been given by taking this path.
									Transition to professional life is a key word in my life right now and I am feeling that every day gives me an opportunity to get closer where I want to be "when I grow up".
									Who knows how the business world, or the world in general will look like in the next five or ten years? I think one of the best practices facing the uncertainty is to be innovative… with an efficient 
									and sustainable mindset we can help create the environment we want and the future generations would like to be in. I believe that data and technology
									being utilized in meaningful ways will be the key that helps provide the change for better. This is why I have chosen as my goal to become a Future Data Specialist.</p>
									<p><b>Passion, Grit & Curiosity </b>– Love the feeling I get from challenging myself and expanding my comfort zone. Whether it is facing a fear or trying something new.</p>
