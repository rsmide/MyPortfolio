# MyPortfolio

This is my first portfolio website that I created using a layout from HTML5 UP! The idea for this website is to work purely as an interface with short project descriptions and links to them, as well as my socials. The website has two pages, from which the first one acts like the main page and contains links to all the showcased projects, while the second page includes a short biography.

I made some slight changes to the original layout with css, implementing a submenu with anchor links to different project categories. All the pictures are either owned by me or from unsplash.com.

This website is not yet in full function. The only project link currently working is the one for Red Light Camera Violations Viz project.
